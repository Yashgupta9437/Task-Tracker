### Task Management

#### Creating Tasks
- Click the **"Add Task"** button in the top-right corner
- Fill in the required title and optional description
- Set priority level (High, Medium, Low)
- Optionally set a due date
- Click **"Create Task"** to save

#### Editing Tasks
- Click the **edit icon** (pencil) on any task
- Modify any field in the popup form
- Click **"Update Task"** to save changes

#### Completing Tasks
- Click the **circle icon** next to any task to mark it as complete
- Completed tasks will show a checkmark and appear with reduced opacity
- Click again to mark as incomplete

#### Deleting Tasks
- Click the **trash icon** on any task
- Confirm deletion in the popup dialog
- **Note**: This action cannot be undone

### Filtering and Search

#### Filter Options
- **All Tasks**: Shows all tasks regardless of status
- **Pending**: Shows only incomplete tasks
- **Completed**: Shows only completed tasks

Each filter tab displays the current count of tasks in that category.

#### Search Functionality
- Use the search bar to find tasks by title or description
- Search is case-insensitive and updates results in real-time
- Combine search with filters for precise task discovery

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/           # React components
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx    # Main dashboard layout
│   ├── Login.tsx        # Authentication component
│   ├── TaskForm.tsx     # Task creation/editing form
│   ├── TaskItem.tsx     # Individual task display
│   ├── TaskList.tsx     # Task list container
│   └── TaskFilter.tsx   # Filter tabs component
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
│   └── Task.ts         # Task-related types
├── utils/               # Utility functions
│   └── localStorage.ts  # Local storage operations
├── App.tsx             # Main application component
├── main.tsx            # Application entry point
└── index.css           # Global styles
```

### Component Hierarchy

```
App
├── Login (when not authenticated)
└── Dashboard (when authenticated)
    ├── TaskFilter
    ├── TaskList
    │   └── TaskItem (multiple)
    └── TaskForm (modal)
```

### State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with hooks:

- **App Level**: Authentication state and user session
- **Dashboard Level**: Task list, filters, search query, and UI state
- **Component Level**: Form inputs, loading states, and local UI state

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Username stored in localStorage for session persistence
2. **Task Operations**: All CRUD operations immediately sync with localStorage
3. **Real-time Updates**: State changes trigger immediate UI updates
4. **Persistence**: Data survives browser refreshes and sessions

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Data Persistence**: Browser localStorage API
- **Development Tools**: ESLint for code quality

### Key Dependencies

```json
{
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
  "lucide-react": "^0.344.0",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1"
}
```

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

### Performance Optimizations

- **Component Memoization**: Efficient re-rendering with proper key props
- **Local State Management**: Minimal re-renders with targeted state updates
- **Optimized Builds**: Vite's tree-shaking and code splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports for better initial load times

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette

- **Primary**: Indigo to Purple gradient (`from-indigo-600 to-purple-600`)
- **Success**: Green tones for completed tasks and low priority
- **Warning**: Yellow/Amber for medium priority tasks
- **Error**: Red tones for high priority and overdue tasks
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds

### Typography

- **Headings**: Bold weights with proper hierarchy
- **Body Text**: Regular weight with 150% line height for readability
- **Labels**: Medium weight for form labels and UI elements

### Spacing System

- **Base Unit**: 8px grid system
- **Component Padding**: 16px, 24px, 32px
- **Element Margins**: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px

### Animation Guidelines

- **Duration**: 200ms for micro-interactions, 300ms for larger transitions
- **Easing**: CSS ease-in-out for natural motion
- **Hover States**: Subtle scale transforms (1.05x) and color transitions
- **Loading States**: Smooth spinner animations

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with proper type definitions
- **Components**: Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **File Organization**: One component per file with co-located types

### Adding New Features

1. **Create Types**: Define TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/`
2. **Build Components**: Create reusable components in `src/components/`
3. **Add Utilities**: Helper functions go in `src/utils/`
4. **Update State**: Modify state management in parent components
5. **Style Components**: Use Tailwind classes following the design system

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tasks not persisting after refresh**
- Check browser localStorage permissions
- Ensure localStorage is not disabled in private/incognito mode

**Styling not loading correctly**
- Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check for conflicting CSS rules

**Performance issues with many tasks**
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for 100+ tasks
- Add pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets

### Browser Storage Limits

- localStorage has a 5-10MB limit per domain
- Each task uses approximately 200-500 bytes
- Theoretical limit: ~10,000-25,000 tasks per user
